## Problem Section

### Headline
**Chat interfaces are broken for serious thinking.**

### Pain Points (3 columns)

#### 🚇 Tunnel Vision
Traditional chats force linear thinking. 
Wrong turn? Start over or scroll forever.

#### 🔍 Lost Context  
"Where was that great answer?"
Buried in a 200-message thread.

#### 🔄 Prompt Roulette
Rewriting prompts hoping for better output.
No way to compare alternatives.

---

## Solution Section

### Headline
**Think in graphs, not threads.**

### Visual
*Side-by-side: Chat interface (messy) vs Tension canvas (organized)*

### Key Message
Tension transforms AI conversations into **spatial maps of thought**.
Every branch preserved. Every experiment visible. Every insight findable.
